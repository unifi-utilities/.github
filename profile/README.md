## Welcome to the new home of boostchickens udm-utilities 

Since the project has grown so far beyond just me I determined it is in the best interest of the project to no longer be singularly associated with my name.  There have been substantial contributions by many.  Also, this will allow us to organize different repo's for different UniFi devices


## Community
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io:/discord/939817841107034172?label=Discord&logo=Discord&style=for-the-badge "Discord")](https://discord.gg/8zqrQJFghg)

The discord is small but lively, if you need in person help you are likely to find it there!  There is a dedicated group of people who volunteer their time to keep the project flourishing.

## Rules

This project was created in peace and love, is free, and will always remain free. Let's keep that spirit alive.  
1. Please treat everyone in the community as an equal. 
1. People from all skill levels and backgrounds find use of this project and it is our goal to mentor and grow people's skills.  
1. Constructive criticism is encouraged, all other types are not.  
1. Please take time to consider how you communicate with others.

## Words of Wisdom 

Everyone on the Ubiquiti discord told me this project was a stupid idea, and useless.  Nobody would use a UDM/P in this way.  Have the courage of your convicitions and follow through! If you find use in something, chances are another will as well!
