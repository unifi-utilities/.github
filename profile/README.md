## Welcome to the new home of boostchickens udm-utilities 

Since the project has grown so far beyond just me I determined it is in the best interest of the project to no longer be singularly associated with my name.  There have been substantial contributions by many.  Also, this will allow us to organize different repo's for different UniFi devices

## Hey! I want my repo to live here also!

If you are interested in moving your repo here please contact boostchicken.  As long as you are willing to maintain it to a reasonable degree we will have you.  Get your work seen by the UniFi customization community at large!


## Rules

This project was created in peace and love, is free, and will always remain free. Let's keep that spirit alive.  Please treat everyone in the community as an equal. People from all skill levels and backgrounds find use of this project and it is our goal to mentor and grow people's skills.  Basically, if you wouldn't do it at your job, don't do it here. Stay professional at all times.

## Contributing
PRs accepted in all repos!  
Always looking for maintainers who can dedicate a small amount of their time to reviewing PR's and other administrative tasks.  This project is a great place to get your feet wet if you are new to OSS!

## Community

The discord is small but lively, if you need in person help you are likely to find it there!  There is a dedicated group of people who volunteer there time to keep the project flourishing.

### Words of Wisdom 
Everyone on the Ubiquiti discord told me this project was a stupid idea, and useless.  Nobody would use a UDM/P in this way.  Have the courage of your convicitions and follow through! If you find use in something, chances are another will as well! I am glad I did. Maintaining this repo has been an honor and I never dreamed it would get this big.
